# Third Party Risk Management Policy

## 1. Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to establish requirements for assessing and managing risks associated with third party vendors, partners, suppliers and service providers (hereafter referred to as "third parties") that have access to Alma Security's confidential data and/or internal networks. The goal is to ensure that third parties implement appropriate security controls to protect Alma Security's data and systems.

## 2. Scope
This policy applies to all third parties that are provided access to confidential Alma Security data, including customer data and intellectual property, and/or have access to Alma Security's internal IT networks and systems. This includes third parties that:
- Have access to Alma Security's confidential data, either on their own systems or Alma Security's 
- Connect to Alma Security's internal networks to provide services
- Develop software or systems on behalf of Alma Security
- Have physical access to Alma Security facilities where confidential data is stored or processed

## 3. Third Party Risk Management Due Diligence 
All third parties in scope must undergo a risk assessment and due diligence review prior to being granted access to confidential data or Alma Security networks. The depth of the assessment will be based on the level of access required and the sensitivity of the data accessed. At a minimum, the following will be required:

### Tier 1 (High Risk - access to highly sensitive data or privileged system access)  
- Detailed security assessment questionnaire covering all applicable security domains
- Review of third party's security policies, procedures and practices
- On-site security assessment for critical vendors to validate controls
- Penetration testing of third party systems that will access Alma Security data

### Tier 2 (Medium Risk - access to internal systems and limited sensitive data)
- Abbreviated security assessment questionnaire focused on key risks
- Remote validation of critical security controls 
- Penetration testing of third party systems at Alma Security's discretion

### Tier 3 (Low Risk - no access to sensitive data or internal systems) 
- Basic security questionnaire to identify any red flags
- Validation of industry certifications and security incident history

## 4. Third Party Access Management
Access to Alma Security's systems and data by third parties must be restricted and controlled. 
- Third parties will only be granted the minimum access necessary to perform their function
- Access will be granted only for the duration required and promptly removed when no longer needed  
- Privileged access will use multi-factor authentication and be monitored for anomalous activity
- Remote access will use encrypted connections and restrict access to authorized systems only
- Third party accounts will be reviewed at least quarterly to revalidate access

## 5. Contractual Requirements
Appropriate security requirements must be incorporated into contracts with third parties based on risk tier, including:

- Clearly defined data security responsibilities of the third party
- Minimum security control requirements based on risk tier and data accessed
- Right to audit third party's security practices and controls 
- Requirements for prompt notification of security incidents impacting Alma Security
- Liability provisions for losses resulting from the third party's failure to meet contractual security obligations
- Data destruction attestation requirements upon termination of the contract

## 6. Compliance  
- The Security Team will assess third party compliance with this policy as part of the due diligence process and ongoing monitoring.
- Third parties must promptly notify Alma Security of any actual or suspected breaches of their contractual security obligations.
- Alma Security reserves the right to terminate the relationship with any third party that fails to meet the requirements of this policy.
