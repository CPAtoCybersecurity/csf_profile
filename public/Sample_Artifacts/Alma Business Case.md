# Alma Security Business Case

## Inspiration

The inspiration for this case and the original idea for Alma Security came from Daniel Miesslerâ€™s open source Telos project here:  
https://github.com/danielmiessler/Telos/blob/main/corporate_telos.md

## Company Overview

Alma Security is a security startup based in Redwood City, California. Founded in 2021 by Chris Meyers, the former CTO of Sigma Systems and a senior security engineer at HPE, Alma aims to revolutionize the authentication market by providing continuous user authentication based on a holistic view of a user's identity. The company has 300 employees and annual recurring revenue of approximately $36 million.

## Mission and Goals  

Alma's mission is to enable businesses to continuously authenticate users based on their "whole selves." Its ambitious goals include:

1. Achieving 20% market share and 10,000 active customers by January 2025
2. Attaining a 90%+ customer trust score by 2025
3. Reducing churn below 5% by August 2024
4. Launching in Europe and India in 2024
5. Integrating new behavioral and biometric features in 2024

## Security Risks and Challenges 

As an authentication provider safeguarding sensitive customer data, strong security is imperative for Alma to maintain customer trust. However, the security team faces several challenges:

- 50% understaffed after losing 5 key employees in 2022
- Lack of 24x7 security monitoring of infrastructure and logs
- 3+ days to investigate potential malicious behavior
- Incomplete asset inventory and attack surface visibility
- Low public trust score after security incidents in 2022

## Security Strategy and Investments 

To address these risks, the security team is pursuing initiatives including:

1. Hiring 5 top-tier security professionals
2. Implementing an attack surface management solution
3. Enhancing detection and response capabilities
4. Deploying an asset inventory system integrated with attack surface management
5. Rebuild public trust through transparency about progress

The security team tracks KPIs to measure progress, including time to detect (TTD) and investigate (TTI) malicious behavior, time to remediate critical vulnerabilities on crown jewel (TTR-CJC) and all systems (TTR-C), and public trust score (PT).

## Organizational Structure  

Alma has approximately 300 employees organized into the following departments:

- Engineering/R&D: 110
- Sales & Marketing: 75
- Customer Success: 35
- Finance & Accounting: 20
- HR & Admin: 15
- IT & Security: 45 (30 IT, 15 Security)

The security team of 15 is divided into detection & response, vulnerability management, and other specialties. Key personnel include:

- Nadia Khan, detection & response expert
- Chris Magann & Tigan Wang, vulnerability management experts

## Financials 

With 300 employees and estimated revenue per employee of $120,000 in the software/SaaS industry, Alma likely generates annual recurring revenue (ARR) in the range of $36 million. Its annual operating expenses are estimated at $50-60 million based on typical ratios for a fast-growing startup, implying it is not yet profitable as it invests heavily in product development and go-to-market.

The security budget is not provided but likely represents 10-15% of total operating expenses, or roughly $5-9 million, based on benchmarks for a SaaS business of Alma's scale and risk profile. This covers the 15-person team, security tools and software, audits and pen testing, bug bounties, compliance, and related areas.

## Key Decisions and Discussion Questions 

As Alma's leadership team, key questions to consider include:

1. Is the security team's current strategy and roadmap appropriately prioritized given the company's business goals, risks, and resource constraints? How would you modify or sequence the initiatives differently?
    
2. The security team is understaffed but has an ambitious agenda. Should Alma hire more security professionals or outsource/automate some functions? What are the tradeoffs?
    
3. How can Alma balance the need to move fast to achieve its growth goals with the imperative to secure its product and maintain customer trust? What processes can help manage this tension?
    
4. How should Alma think about the optimal level of transparency to provide about its security journey and incidents? What are the risks and benefits?
    
5. What leading indicators, beyond those currently tracked, would give Alma's management better visibility into its security posture and improvement over time?
    
In conclusion, Alma Security is at a pivotal juncture as it looks to scale its disruptive authentication solution while strengthening security. Deliberate choices about security strategy, resource allocation, and risk management processes will be critical to achieving its mission and sustaining growth. Management must weigh difficult trade-offs but keep customer trust at the center of decision-making.
