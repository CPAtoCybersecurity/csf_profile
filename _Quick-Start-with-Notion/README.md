# Cybersecurity Framework Quickstart — NIST CSF Maturity Wiki

A drop-in Notion workspace for assessing maturity against the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. Preserves the full 6 → 22 → 106 hierarchy. You score at the subcategory level; Notion rolls scores up to category and function automatically. Designed as preparation work — when you migrate to a dedicated GRC platform, your enriched subcategory CSV is the single artifact you need.

## Who this is for

GRC practitioners, security teams, and consultants who want to start a CSF assessment **today** without waiting on tool procurement. You want notes, observations, owners, and evidence captured against every subcategory; live category- and function-level rollups as you score; and a clean export when the GRC platform is ready.

## What you get

```

## Scoring rubric (CMMI-style 0.0–5.0)

- `0.0` Non-existent — control does not exist
- `1.0` Initial — ad-hoc, undocumented
- `2.0` Repeatable — informal patterns, partial documentation
- `3.0` Defined — documented, communicated, consistently applied
- `4.0` Managed — measured, reviewed, evidence-driven
- `5.0` Optimized — continuously improved, proactive

Intermediate values (e.g. `3.5`) express partial progression. This is a defensible default; swap it for a CSF-Tier-aligned scale (1 Partial / 2 Risk-Informed / 3 Repeatable / 4 Adaptive), CMMI-DEV, COBIT capability levels, or any organization-specific scale by editing this section — the database schema is rubric-agnostic.

## How aggregation works

**TL;DR — you only ever enter a number in one place: the `Score` field on a Subcategory page.** The 22 Category averages and 6 Function averages are computed by Notion automatically via Rollup properties. You never average by hand.

### The data flow

```
   You score a Subcategory  (0.0–5.0)
              │
              ▼
   Each Category has a Rollup that says:
      "Average the Score field across all Subcategories that point at me"
              │
              ▼
   Each Function has a Rollup that says:
      "Average the rollup across all Categories that point at me"
```

Scores flow up; nothing flows down. The 22 Categories don't have their own `Score` field — only a Rollup of their child Subcategories. The 6 Functions don't have a `Score` field either — only a Rollup of their child Categories.

### Why three linked databases (not one)

| Database | Rows | Has `Score` field? | Has Rollup? |
|----------|------|---------------------|-------------|
| Functions | 6 | no | yes — averages this Function's Categories' rollups |
| Categories | 22 | no | yes — averages this Category's Subcategories' Scores |
| Subcategories | 106 | **yes — you type it here** | no |

Notion's Rollup property only works across **explicit Relations between databases** — it can't aggregate inside a single database. That's why this wiki ships as three databases linked by relations, not one giant 106-row table with Function and Category columns. Three databases gives you working rollups for free; one table doesn't.

### Worked example — GV (GOVERN)

The Function **GOVERN (GV)** has 6 Categories. One of them is **GV.SC — Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management**, which contains 10 Subcategories (GV.SC-01 through GV.SC-10).

Imagine you score 4 of those 10 Subcategories so far:

| Subcategory | Score |
|-------------|-------|
| GV.SC-01 | 4.0 |
| GV.SC-02 | 3.0 |
| GV.SC-03 | 2.5 |
| GV.SC-04 | 3.5 |
| GV.SC-05..10 | (empty — not yet scored) |

**Category-level rollup (GV.SC):** Notion averages the 4 entered Scores (empty rows are skipped):

`(4.0 + 3.0 + 2.5 + 3.5) ÷ 4 = 3.25`

The `GV.SC` row in your Categories database displays **3.25**.

**Function-level rollup (GV):** assume your other 5 Categories under GV show rollups of `2.0, 4.0, 3.0, 2.5, 3.5`. The Function-level rollup averages those 6 Category rollups (including GV.SC's 3.25):

`(3.25 + 2.0 + 4.0 + 3.0 + 2.5 + 3.5) ÷ 6 = 3.04`

The `GV` row in your Functions database displays **3.04**.

Score one more Subcategory under GV.SC and the GV.SC rollup recomputes; that ripples up to the GV rollup automatically — no formulas, no manual refresh.

### How partial scoring is handled

Notion's `Rollup → Average` **ignores empty values**. So if you've only scored 30 of 106 Subcategories, the rollups reflect those 30 — they aren't dragged toward zero by the unscored rows. A half-finished assessment doesn't lie; it just shows you a partial picture you know is partial.

**If you want empty Subcategories to count as 0** (treating "not scored" as "non-existent"), use this approach instead:

- Add a Formula property called `EffectiveScore`: `if(empty(prop("Score")), 0, prop("Score"))`
- Configure the Category-level Rollup to roll up `EffectiveScore` instead of `Score`

That way unscored rows contribute 0 to the average, and your rollups punish coverage gaps.

### Why average Categories first (not all Subcategories directly)

You could skip the Category layer and have each Function rollup average all of its Subcategory scores directly. That is **not** what this wiki does, and here's why:

- **Equal weight per domain.** CSF Categories are organizational domains, and risk officers usually treat them as equal weight. **GV.SC** has 10 Subcategories; **GV.OV** (Oversight) has 3. If a Function rollup averaged all subcategories directly, big categories would drown out small ones — a 10-Subcategory category would carry over 3× the weight of a 3-Subcategory category in the Function score. The two-stage design (Subcategories → Category average → Function average of Category averages) treats every Category as one equal domain.
- **Faster feedback loop.** People work through one Category at a time. Seeing the Category rollup update as you score keeps the assessment moving. The Function rollup then tells the higher-altitude story.

If you prefer **equal weight per Subcategory** (so big categories dominate the Function score), set up a single rollup on Functions that traverses through Categories down to Subcategories using Notion's nested rollup. That's a different aggregation philosophy — pick one and document it.

### Adding a gap view

The `Target Score` column on each Subcategory is your aspirational maturity. To surface the gap visually:

1. Add a Formula property on Subcategories: `Gap = Target Score - Score`
2. Sort or color-code your Subcategory views by `Gap` to see the biggest deficits first
3. (Optional) Add a Category-level rollup of `Average(Target Score)` so each Category shows current maturity, target maturity, and the gap between them — that gives you a per-domain investment-priority list

## Notion import — step by step

1. Create a Notion page named **CSF Wiki** (or whatever you prefer).
2. Add individual new pages and select Import for `functions.csv`, `categories.csv`, and `subcategories.csv`— each becomes its own inline database. Notion uses the first column as the database title, so each database's title column will be `ID` (`GV`, `GV.SC`, `GV.SC-04`, etc.).
3. Convert the relation columns:
   - Open the **Categories** database. Find the `Function` column (currently text). Click the column header → change type to **Relation** with target = the Functions database. Notion offers to auto-link rows whose `Function` text value matches a Function `ID` — accept.
   -

   - Open the **Subcategories** database. Convert the `Category` column from text to Relation → Categories. When prompted for two-way relation, **enable it** — this creates a back-relation on Categories that the rollup in step 4 requires.
   - While still in **Subcategories**: convert the `Score` column type from Text to **Number**. Do the same for `Target Score`. Rollups can only Average numeric fields; text fields only offer Count.
4. Add the rollups:
   - On **Categories**, add a new property of type **Rollup**. Source = the `subcategories.csv` back-relation. Property = `Score`. Calculate = `Average`. Decimal places = 2. If you see a warning that the target property type changed, re-select `Score` in the picker to refresh it.
   - On **Categories**, add a second property of type **Formula**. Formula body: `prop("Rollup")`. This mirrors the rollup as a plain number — Notion does not allow one Rollup to directly target another Rollup, so the Formula is the bridge.
   - On **Functions**, add a new property of type **Relation** pointing to the Categories database.
   - On **Functions**, add a new property of type **Rollup**. Source = the Categories relation. Property = `Formula` (the one you just created). Calculate = `Average`. Decimal places = 2.
5. Bulk-paste each `subcategories/{ID}.md` into the matching Subcategory page body. Two routes:
   - **Manual:** open a Subcategory page and paste the file body — Notion converts markdown on paste.
   - **Bulk:** Notion's **Import → Markdown & CSV** can ingest the whole `subcategories/` directory in one shot, then merge each markdown page into the matching database row by ID.
6. Verify relation cells. The auto-link in step 3 wires rows by matching text IDs. Spot-check a few: open a Category row and confirm the `Function` relation cell shows the correct Function; open a Subcategory row and confirm `Category` shows the correct Category.
7. Pin a top-level page view that shows the Functions database with its Rollup column visible. That's your dashboard.

After step 4 your rollups are live. Score a single Subcategory and watch the Category and Function rollups update.

## Schema

`functions.csv` — `ID, Name, Description`

`categories.csv` — `ID, Name, Description, Function`
- `Function` references `functions.csv ID` for the Notion relation

`subcategories.csv` — `ID, Description, Category, Function, Owner, Target Score, Score, Last Reviewed, Observations, Evidence, Notes`
- `Category` references `categories.csv ID` for the Notion relation
- `Function` is a denormalized convenience column (`GV`, `ID`, `PR`, `DE`, `RS`, `RC`) — keep it as plain Text for fast filtering by Function without traversing the Category relation. You don't need to convert it to a Notion Relation; the Subcategories → Categories → Functions chain already gives you rollup math via that relation.
- `Owner`, `Target Score`, `Score`, `Last Reviewed`, `Observations`, `Evidence`, `Notes` ship empty — fill them in as you assess

## GRC migration path

`subcategories.csv` exported back out of Notion — now enriched with Score, Target Score, Owner, Last Reviewed, Observations, Evidence, and Notes — is the single artifact to feed into your GRC platform (Archer, Hyperproof, OneTrust, ServiceNow GRC, MetricStream, etc.). Most GRC tools import CSV directly or via a vendor template into which you can map columns 1:1.

The Functions and Categories databases are browsing scaffolding for the Notion stage. Discard them at migration — your GRC tool's CSF taxonomy module already provides them.

## Source data and regeneration

This bundle was generated from a NIST CSF implementation-examples CSV via `_generate.ts`. Counts written: 6 functions, 22 categories, 106 subcategories, 362 implementation examples preserved verbatim on subcategory pages.

To regenerate against an updated source CSV:

```sh
# explicit path
bun run _generate.ts /path/to/CSF-implementation-examples.csv

# or via env var
CSF_SOURCE_CSV=/path/to/CSF-implementation-examples.csv bun run _generate.ts

# or fall back to the bundled source/CSF-implementation-examples.csv
bun run _generate.ts
```

The generator is idempotent — it cleans the `subcategories/` directory and overwrites all CSVs and this README on every run.

## What this wiki deliberately does NOT do

- **Score implementation examples.** Examples are read-only NIST reference text, surfaced on each Subcategory page for context — not their own database rows or pages.
- **Auto-aggregate scores in CSV.** Aggregation is Notion's job, done via Rollup properties on the relations.
- **Prescribe the "right" rubric.** The default CMMI-style 0–5 scale is a defensible starting point; pick your organization's calibration and edit the rubric section accordingly.
